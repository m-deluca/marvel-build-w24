            <h3 class="lb_heading">Isabel Susannah "Belly" Conklin</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Belly used to be gawky and awkward, but when she turns 16 she is starting to turn heads-and it’s taking some getting used to. Conrad Fisher, the boy she’s loved forever, the boy who never even looked in her direction - is paying attention to her. It’s exhilarating to suddenly be an object of desire… but it’s also scary.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Last summer Belly grew up in all kinds of ways– she fell in love, had her heart broken, and she broke some hearts too. This summer, she must face the aftermath of those decisions and a Cousins Beach that might never be the same.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Conrad Beck Fisher</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Conrad is a straight-A student and a star athlete. Conrad has always been responsible and serious — and the boy that Belly has yearned for her whole life. Belly arrives at his family’s summer house to discover that Conrad has become moody and distant — something has changed in him, but he’s not saying what.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Conrad always seemed to have the answers - until the past couple of years turned his world upside down. Now, he’s finishing up his freshman year of college and still having a hard time asking others for help.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Jeremiah Fisher</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Jeremiah is a popular, bisexual, athletic, playful and easygoing character who is the life of the party, incredibly magnetic and flirts with everyone.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Jeremiah is a sunshine boy with golden retriever energy who’s always been able to make Belly smile. The two have been best friends since they were kids, but things between them have taken a complicated turn.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Susannah Fisher</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Warm-hearted, free-spirited, Susannah is Laurel's best friend who hosts the two families every summer in her luxurious beach town home.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                She is Conrad and Jeremiah’s mom and the supreme hostess of the summer house. She’s always seen Belly as the daughter she never had and secretly hopes Belly will marry one of her boys someday.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Laurel Park</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Laurel is a novelist with a wry sense of humor and an aversion to technology. Since her divorce a year ago, Laurel has been stressed and unfocused, which is affecting her writing for the first time in her career. She is also the mother of Belly.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Now an author whose recent memoir is about her decades-long friendship with Susannah, she’s always been fiercely devoted to her kids Belly and Steven and the Fisher boys, but Laurel had a tumultuous year that’s put distance between her and those she loves most.

            <p class="lb_text">
                He is handsome, a little vain, and a high achiever. Steven is Belly's snarky older brother who, last season, was becoming his own man.            
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Now, Steven is a hustler with big dreams for his future, ready to leave high school and his hometown behind. He’s looking forward to making the most of his last carefree summer before he leaves for college come fall.
